# micc-api-samples
Repository for creating sample usages of the [MiCC](http://www.mitel.com/products/collaboration-software/micontact-center-business) API.

These samples should be used with the following mindset:
* that they can and will change without warning.
* should not be used as is but rather as a base for the aspect of the software being demoed.
* they should be tailored to the specifc needs of the demo.
* as with any demo, should be tested in that specific system and scenario at a proximate time to the demo.  *Do not tempt the demo gods by winging it during a live presentation.*

If a sample appears to be misbehaving, the first place to check for problems is the browser console.
